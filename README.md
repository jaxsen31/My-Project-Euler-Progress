# My-Project-Euler-Progress
Here are my attempts at the questions from https://projecteuler.net/about using Java

They are by no means the best/most efficient ways of attempting the questions but it's what I thought of. I started learning to code in Java at the start of 2020 and have been doing Project Euler questions on the side to supplement my learning. I also find them really fun as they are mainly math related. I initially did the questions on Eclipse but after switching over to Intellij, I might've accidentally deleted all my code and so, have re-did all the questions from the start with comments regularly included to explain what I'm doing.

I haven't used many complex aspects of Java as I'm still much of a beginner, so I think the most complicated things I've done would probably be manipulating Array lists or Hash maps. I try to stay away from using BigInteger in my code for no real good reason, and instead use Array lists to hold each digit or some other method.

Edit 1 (26/6/20) added questions 41 - 50
